MARIN3R implements a control plane to deploy, configure and operate a fleet of envoy instances within a Kubernetes cluster.
It operates a group of gateways and Pod sidecar containers to provide general purpose functionality required to operate production systems.

Features:
* Deploy and manage an Envoy xDS server using the DiscoveryService custom resource.
* Inject Envoy sidecar containers based on Pod annotations.
* Deploy Envoy as a Kubernetes Deployment using the EnvoyDeployment custom resource.
* Dynamic Envoy configuration and re-configuration using the EnvoyConfig custom resource.
* Use Kubernetes Secrets as certificate sources.
* Syntactic validation of Envoy configurations.
* Lifecycle management of Envoy containers (graceful shutdown and connection draining).
* Self-healing.
